There are many reasons to criticize Trump but he didn't start any new war during his mandate, this is undeniable. Biden will likely return to old style warfare based foreign policy instead of sanctions. The world won't certainly be a safer place.
 Anyone who has Modi's support is doomed to lose because the world hates fascists. Trump was a fascist,  Modi supported him,  today Americans have proved that they don't accept fascists. After Trump, it is Modi's turn, he also has to go soon as this world is not for fascists.
