Politicians like Biden  others started foreign wars, but forgot Veterans afterwards! Over 300K Vets died waiting for weeks/months for care under Obiden! Trump signed the VA Accountability Act  over 11K apathetic VA workers were fired! Trump's a leader, Biden's a failure!
Trump tapped AmyConeyBarrett to help him kill ObamaCare. He's getting his way. 10s of millions will lose healthcare during COVID19 pandemic. But this will ALSO kill AnthonyFauci's plan to end HIV/AIDS . Countless people will DIE! We must act!

I thought of this quote from MacBeth. Trump “Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more: it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.”
I am concerned at the vast number of Trump supporters who truly believe he's a victim of voter fraud. They have spent 4 years listening to his lies  cannot discern truth from desperation anymore. Makes for a dangerous transition  continued division. Elections2020
